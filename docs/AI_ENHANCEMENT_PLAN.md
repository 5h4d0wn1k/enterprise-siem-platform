## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance the Enterprise SIEM Platform with advanced AI capabilities. The enhancements focus on two key areas:

1. **AI-Based Threat Detection**: Implementing machine learning models to identify complex attack patterns, detect anomalies, and reduce false positives through behavioral analysis and predictive intelligence.

2. **AI-Based Data Security Posture Management (DSPM)**: Continuously monitoring, assessing, and enhancing the organization's data security through AI-driven analysis of data sensitivity, access patterns, potential vulnerabilities, and compliance status.

These enhancements will transform the SIEM platform from a rules-based system into an intelligent security solution capable of adaptive learning, predictive analysis, and automated response to emerging threats.

## Current System Architecture

The existing Enterprise SIEM Platform utilizes a modular architecture with the following primary components:

- **Log Collectors**: Gather security events from various sources
- **Event Queue**: Buffer for collected events
- **Event Analyzers**: Process events using rule-based detection
- **Alert Queue**: Buffer for generated alerts
- **Alerters**: Notification systems for security incidents
- **Dashboard**: Web interface for monitoring and management

The current platform primarily relies on rule-based detection methods defined in configuration files. While effective for known threat patterns, these methods have limitations in detecting novel attacks, complex behavioral anomalies, and maintaining data security posture across dynamic environments.

## AI Enhancement Overview

6. Enable predictive security measures and proactive threat hunting
7. Deliver comprehensive visibility into data access patterns and anomalies

### Key AI Capabilities to Implement

1. **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns that deviate from baseline behavior
2. **Behavioral Analysis**: Model normal user, system, and network behaviors to detect deviations
3. **Correlation Engine**: Advanced correlation of disparate events to identify attack chains
4. **Automated Triage**: Intelligent prioritization of security alerts
5. **Data Classification**: Automated identification and labeling of sensitive data
6. **Access Intelligence**: Analysis of data access patterns to identify risks
7. **Compliance Monitoring**: Continuous assessment against regulatory frameworks
8. **Risk Prediction**: Forecasting potential security incidents before they occur
